              Hey! I&apos;m Andranik, a radio electronics engineer turned developer, originally from Odesa, Ukraine, and
              currently based in Moldova for the past three years. My expertise spans a broad range of technologies
              centered on JavaScript and TypeScript, with a strong focus on React and its ecosystem, including Redux
              Toolkit and React Router. I&apos;m skilled in working with UI frameworks like Material UI and have
              experience maintaining internal UI kits, but I enjoy using whatever tools are best suited for the project,
              always investigating, comparing, and implementing best practices.

            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              I&apos;ve contributed to projects in e-commerce, healthcare, and finance, and I&apos;ve actively
              participated in key UI/UX and application design discussions. I&apos;m passionate about building
              enterprise-level applications from scratch, optimizing performance, and applying best practices throughout
              development.

              Outside of work, I kickbox, cycle, and play chess. I also love cooking in the fresh air and spending time
              with my family and friends.

              I&apos;m casually exploring new job opportunities where I can utilize my passion for coding, strive for
              excellence, and maintain a healthy work-life balance while connecting with interesting individuals. If you
              think you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect ðŸ”—
